# Autonomous Career Scout

Autonomous Career Scout is an Agentic AI project designed to discover, analyze, evaluate, and recommend job opportunities.

The long-term vision is to build a career intelligence platform capable of collecting opportunities from multiple sources, analyzing compatibility against a candidate profile, tracking career trends, identifying skill gaps, and supporting career decisions through AI-powered insights.

# Vision

Example goal:

```text
Find remote QA Engineer jobs in Canada.
```

The user should not need to manually search for jobs and provide URLs.

The system will be responsible for:

* Discovering opportunities
* Collecting job data
* Evaluating compatibility
* Ranking opportunities
* Generating recommendations
* Tracking career progress
* Producing reports and insights

---

# Current Capabilities

The current version already supports:

* Resume parsing from DOCX files
* Candidate profile extraction
* Job description parsing
* Skill extraction
* Match score calculation
* Career recommendations
* Application decision analysis
* Opportunity analysis
* OpenAI-powered explanations
* JSON report generation
* PostgreSQL persistence
* Dockerized database infrastructure

---

# Objectives

* Search for job opportunities automatically
* Extract and normalize job descriptions
* Analyze job requirements using AI
* Compare job requirements against a candidate profile
* Classify opportunities as High, Medium, or Low Match
* Generate detailed reports with reasoning traces
* Store historical analyses
* Build an autonomous career assistant using Agentic AI concepts
